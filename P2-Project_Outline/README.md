## Submission Instructions

### Overview
Wanting to creating a vitural character creation and meeting ground for people who love DnD(Dungeons and Dragons).
What the service or program would help with is people creating characters. If you ever tried or played dungeon creating a character can make or break a game before it ever actually gets off the ground. So what I want to create in order to help with this process is something that walk people through the first character they ever create on the site. Then from there anytime they want to create a new character they can pull key features or moments from the "Parent" chraracter and have something like a bloodline start. Allowing others to see where their ancestors came from, who they partied with in the past, and what great deed they did to lay a foundation for their next generation.
